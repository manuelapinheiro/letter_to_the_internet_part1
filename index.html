  I would like to thank you for entertaining me.
  </p>
  
  Sure, perhaps this didnâ€™t always take the most moral avenue, but you made sure I always had <a href="https://libgen.is/" target="_blank">something to read</a> and access to the <a href="https://ww25.soap2day.day/" target="_blank">newest episode of my favorite show</a>.
  
  You allowed me to <a href="https://www.harrypotter.com/news/discover-your-hogwarts-house-on-wizarding-world" target="_blank">explore different universes</a> and dive deep (sometimes a little <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank">too deep</a>) into my interests. 
    
  </p>
      
  I would like to thank you for teaching me so much. At times, this was painful. Like <a href="https://www.ixl.com/" target="_blank"> extremely painful</a>. Other times, you made learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL1jmJaUkaQ&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPHzzYuWy6fYEaX9mQQ8oGr&index=7" target="_blank">fun</a>! There were times when I could not have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0PdG_aZLFg" target="_blank">done it</a> without you. Trust me, I would <a href="https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/physics/OpenStax%20Physics-Student%20Solution%20Manual.pdf" target="_blank">not have survived</a>. Because of you, I have even learned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs" target="_blank"> history of the entire world</a>!!
  
  <br>
  
  <br>
  
  Thank you for making me laugh. From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdkwu2FvFfI" target="_blank">origins of social media</a> to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gossip-girl-title-remixes-go-piss-girl" target="_blank">modern memes</a>, you are responsible for shaping my sense of humor into what it is <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVfkdQxXgAIy0VE.jpg" target="_blank"> today</a>.
  
  <br>
  
  <br>
  
  I want to thank you for inspiring me to create. You showed me that I could do so much with my computer and introduced me to art forms I would <a href="https://i0.wp.com/tortoise.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/338/2021/04/e44.png?fit=680%2C345&ssl=1" target="_blank">not have otherwise known</a>. I found online <a href="https://br.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">comm</a><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdashboard" target="_blank">unities</a> that motivated me to keep being creative.

  <br>
  
  <br>
  
  Finally, I would like to input a formal complaint for ruining my attention span. It took me way too long to finish this letter. <a href="https://babylonbee.com/news/gen-z-upset-about-tiktok-ban-for-43-seconds-which-is-the-maximum-amount-of-time-they-can-focus-on-something-thanks-to-tiktok" target="_blank">Uncool</a>.
